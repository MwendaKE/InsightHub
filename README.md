Insight Hub is a personal research and data analysis repository.  
Here, I explore real-world datasets, analyze trends, visualize insights, and derive meaningful conclusions.  

Each project focuses on turning raw data into actionable knowledge, helping understand global trends and support data-driven decision-making.  

## What You’ll Find
- Cleaned and structured datasets from trusted sources (WHO, World Bank, UN, Our World in Data, etc.)
- Python scripts for data analysis and visualization
- Graphs, charts, and reports summarizing findings
- Step-by-step research projects showcasing insights from global data

## Purpose
The goal of Insight Hub is to learn, experiment, and document research projects that extract meaningful insights from real-world data.  
It’s a space for personal growth, learning, and sharing knowledge with a structured approach to data-driven exploration.
