# Step-by-Step Data Analysis Framework

## 1. Pick a Question or Problem
Start with a clear question you want to answer. This will guide what data you collect and how you analyze it.

**Examples:**
- Which patients are most likely to have diabetes?
- Which ad campaign gets more clicks?
- Which countries have the fastest GDP growth?
- What products sell most in December?
- Which students are likely to fail a subject?
- How many users return to my app within 7 days?
- Which cities have the highest air pollution?
- What causes delays in my supply chain?
- Which social media posts get more engagement?
- What time of day has the most traffic accidents?

**Tip:** Make the question specific. “Why are sales low?” is too broad — try “Which product category had the biggest drop in sales last quarter?”

## 2. Get Relevant Data
Choose the right data source. Data quality matters more than quantity.

**Examples of Data Sources:**
- Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle, WHO, World Bank)
- Government portals (e.g., census data)
- APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, News API)
- Your company’s database
- Google Analytics or Firebase app logs
- Surveys or feedback forms
- Web scraping (e.g., product prices from e-commerce sites)
- Sensors or IoT devices
- Social media data (Twitter/X, Reddit, etc.)
- Manual data collection (spreadsheets, field observations)

**Tip:** Always check data licenses and privacy rules before using.

## 3. Clean the Data
Raw data is usually messy. Cleaning makes it usable.

**Key Tasks & Examples:**
- Handle missing values (fill with average, median, or drop rows)
- Remove duplicate rows (e.g., same user recorded twice)
- Convert text dates into proper date format
- Fix inconsistent text (e.g., “NYC” vs “New York City”)
- Remove outliers if they are errors (e.g., negative ages)
- Standardize units (e.g., meters vs. feet)
- Rename confusing column names to simple ones
- Change data types (e.g., numbers stored as strings)
- Trim extra spaces in text columns
- Ensure consistent category names (e.g., "Male", not "M"/"male"/"MALE")

**Tip:** Clean data once and save it — it saves time in future analysis.

## 4. Explore (EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis)
Understand your data before building models.

**Things to Do:**
- Find mean, median, min, max for each column
- Count how many unique values exist in each column
- Make histograms for numeric columns
- Make boxplots to find outliers
- Make scatter plots to see relationships between variables
- Make bar charts for categorical data
- Calculate correlations between numeric columns
- Create pivot tables (e.g., sales by region)
- Check class imbalance (e.g., fraud cases vs. normal transactions)
- Look at time-series trends (e.g., sales per month)

**Tip:** Visualization makes it easier to spot patterns quickly.

## 5. Model / Analyze
Choose a method based on your goal.

**Examples:**
- Group data by categories and calculate percentages
- Use pivot tables to summarize data
- Apply linear regression for predicting numbers (e.g., sales forecast)
- Use logistic regression for yes/no predictions (e.g., churn prediction)
- Train decision trees for classification problems
- Use Naive Bayes for text classification (e.g., spam detection)
- Apply clustering (e.g., segment customers)
- Run A/B tests to compare two options
- Use Bayesian analysis for probabilistic insights
- Use time series models (e.g., ARIMA) for forecasting

**Tip:** Start simple — sometimes pivot tables give 90% of the insight without complex models.

## 6. Draw Insights & Recommend Actions
Turn numbers into plain English.

**Examples of Insights:**
- “Campaign B increases conversion rate by 15%.”
- “Patients with BMI > 30 have 3× higher diabetes risk.”
- “Most returns happen in the first 7 days.”
- “50% of sales come from just 10% of customers.”
- “Morning traffic accidents are 40% higher on Mondays.”
- “The red button gets 20% more clicks than the blue one.”
- “Air pollution peaks during winter months.”
- “Students who attend 80% of classes score 10% higher.”
- “75% of customers prefer free shipping over discounts.”
- “Mobile users spend twice as much time as desktop users.”

**Tip:** Insights should suggest action, not just show a fact.

## 7. Visualize & Share
Communicate results clearly so others can act on them.

**Ways to Present Results:**
- Simple bar chart comparing categories
- Line chart showing trends over time
- Pie chart for proportion data (use sparingly)
- Heatmap for correlations
- Scatter plot with trend line
- Boxplot for distribution comparison
- Dashboard (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)
- Jupyter Notebook with text + plots
- PDF report with key findings
- Short presentation with recommended actions
